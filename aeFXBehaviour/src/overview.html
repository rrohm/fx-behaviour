      <p>This is an addition to the aeFXActions framework that allows for
        declaratively adding behaviour to your FXML GUI.
      </p>

      <h2>Bootstrapping</h2>
      <p>There is no difference in the bootstrapping if you want to use this 
        library. Just follow the bootstrapping advices for the aeFXActions 
        framework:
      </p>
      <p>Compared to ordinary JavaFX applications with FXML UI, there are just a
        few steps to get started with FXML and the aeFXActions framework.</p>
      <p>The framework uses the controller factory callback of the FXMLLoader.
        So, you (merely) have to tell the FXMLLoader that loads your FXML files
        to use the FXActionManager as a controller factory. The followin example 
        illustrates the application initialization with aeFXActions:
      </p>

      <pre>
  public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    FXActionManager myActionControllerFactory = new FXActionManager();

    // Shortcut, if you have a fxml without stylesheets
    //Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(
    //        getClass().getResource("FXMLDocument.fxml"),
    //        null,
    //        null, myActionControllerFactory);

    // use this approach if the fxml uses stylesheets:
    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader();
    fxmlLoader.setLocation(getClass().getResource("FXMLDocument.fxml"));
    fxmlLoader.setControllerFactory(myActionControllerFactory);
    Parent root = (Parent) fxmlLoader.load();

    myActionControllerFactory.initActions();

    // optional: get the action by its type and parametrize it:
    MyAction action = myActionControllerFactory.getAction(MyAction.class);
    action.setText("Erste Aktion");

    Scene scene = new Scene(root);

    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
  }
 
      </pre>
    </div>
