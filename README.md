fx-behaviour
============

The fx-behaviour library is a utility for declaratively defining the behaviour of you JavaFX GUI. Why should you want to do this?
+ There are lots of standard tasks in user interface development: make elements draggable, make controls hide or close a dialog, make elements respond to mouse and keyboard, ...
+ We do not want redundant implementations
+ There is a better way than imperative wiring

This library is an extension to the fx-actions library.
